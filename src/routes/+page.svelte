			<h2 class="homepage__h2">How technology is revolutionizing outdoor living spaces</h2>
			<p class="homepage__p">
				Gone are the days of simple, static outdoor furniture. Today, smart and connected lawn
				furniture is the way of the future. With the integration of technology, these new designs
				offer homeowners a wide range of features and benefits that were once unimaginable.
			</p>
			<p class="homepage__p">
				One of the most notable features of smart lawn furniture is the ability to control and
				customize your outdoor living space through a mobile app or voice commands. This can include
				adjusting the lighting, setting temperature controls, and even playing music. In addition,
				some designs come with built-in sensors that can detect the weather, and automatically
				adjust to provide optimal comfort for the conditions.
			</p>
			<p class="homepage__p">
				Another advantage of smart lawn furniture is the ability to connect to other smart devices
				in your home, such as security cameras, thermostats, and lighting systems. This allows for
				even more control and customization of your outdoor living space, as well as added
				convenience and security.
			</p>
			<p class="homepage__p">
				Smart lawn furniture is also becoming more sustainable, with designs that incorporate solar
				panels and rainwater harvesting systems. This not only helps to reduce energy consumption
				and water usage, but also helps to reduce the environmental impact of outdoor living spaces.
